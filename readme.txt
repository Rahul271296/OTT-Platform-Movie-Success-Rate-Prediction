OTT PLATFORM MOVIE SUCCESS RATE PREDICTION
The world of entertainment has undergone a paradigm shift with the rise of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms. These platforms have become a preferred medium of entertainment for people around the world, and as such, it is essential to understand the factors that contribute to the success of movies on these platforms.

In this project, we have analyzed the success rates of OTT movies using various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and XG Boost. After data preprocessing with Hadoop and SQL, we achieved 86.2% accuracy in predicting the success rate of movies on the OTT platform.
